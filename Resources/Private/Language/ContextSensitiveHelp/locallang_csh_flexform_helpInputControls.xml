			<label index="LLL:EXT:sav_library_plus/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xml:pi_flexform.allowedGroups.description">If you select user groups, user must belong to one of these groups to be allowed to input data in the Front End.</label>

			<label index="LLL:EXT:sav_library_plus/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xml:pi_flexform.inputAdminField.description">Put here a field under the form "tablename.fieldname" (if you use only "fieldname", the main table is taken as "tablename").
This will restrict the input to users that have "Admin" right for this field in their TS Config.
For example, if one user has "extKey_Admin=value1,value2" in his TS Config, he will be allowed to edit or delete items for which "fieldname" is equal to "value1" or "value2" for the extension "extKey".
The fields or the folders which have the attribute "editAdminPlus= 1;" can be modified if the user has the "Admin+" rights. For example, if the TS Config is "extKey_Admin=value1+,value2" , the user is an "Admin+" for the records where "fieldname" is equal to "value1" and just "Admin" for the records where "fieldname" is equal to "value2".
Users become "Super Admin" for the extension "extKey" their TS Config is "extKey_Admin=*".</label>
